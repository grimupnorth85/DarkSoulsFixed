<h2>The Story</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p >The story of Dark Souls II begins with a human who has become Undead, cursed to never die and doomed to eventually become a Hollow,<br>
    a zombie-like being with no memories or purpose. The protagonist is also known as the Bearer of the Curse.<br> 
    To break the curse, the undead travels to the fallen kingdom of Drangleic and is tasked by the Emerald Herald with obtaining four Great Souls from powerful Old Ones,<br>
    whose names are long forgotten and forbidden. Once obtained, the Emerald Herald directs the undead to "Seek the King" in the capital.<br>
    After fighting through the remains of the royal guards, the player encounters the Queen Nashandra, who reveals that the king failed in his duty and fled his kingdom long ago.<br>
    She asks the protagonist to slay the king.<br>
    <br>
    Near the end of the Queen's quest, the player learns that the ruin of the kingdom was in fact caused by Nashandra.<br>
    She came to the king and deceived him into launching an ill-fated invasion across the sea into the lands of the Giants.<br>
    She coveted their souls and sought to steal their power. Though the raid succeeded in stealing the Giant's unspecified power, the Giants retaliated.<br>
    Invading Drangleic, the Giants eventually destroyed the kingdom. With his kingdom in ruins, the king discovered Nashandra's true purpose and locked himself inside the Undead Crypt.<br>
    
    In order to confront Nashandra, the player character travels to the keep of Aldia, the King's brother, to obtain the Ashen Mist Heart, an artifact that allows a form of time travel,<br> 
    by accessing the "memories" of corpses. The player must enter the memories of a deceased Giant to defeat the Giant Lord during the invasion and claim his power for their own.<br>
    Confronting the Emerald Herald one final time, she states that Nashandra is a fragment of Manus, the final boss in the Artorias of the Abyss expansion in Dark Souls.<br>
    She then asks the protagonist to put Nashandra to rest and to take the Throne of Want.<br>
    <br>
    In the Scholar of the First Sin version of the game, the base story changes slightly, notably with the addition of Aldia after the defeat of Nashandra.<br> 
    If the player has defeated King Vendrick, Aldia attempts to help the protagonist understand that there might be a way out of the endless cycle of death and rebirth.<br> 
    The player is given a choice: they can either take the throne, thus allowing the cycle of Age of Fire and Dark to continue;<br>
    or the player can abscond the throne, resisting the effects of Hollowing and following their own unknown path beyond light or dark.</p>
