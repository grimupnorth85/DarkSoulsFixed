    <h2 >What, Where.. And When.. is Dark Souls 3?</h2>
        <p>Dark Souls 3 takes place in a transitory place, revolving around the first flame and the cycle of fire and dark.<br> 
            You play as a protagonist whose goal is to find and return the five Lords of Cinder to their thrones at Firelink Shrine in order to link the flame again.<br>  
            The protagonist is known as an Unkindled, a kind of Undead, although it is never fully enunciated upon what differentiates an Unkindled from other Undead.<br>  
            There are implications that an Unkindled is the remains of an Undead warrior who failed to link the flame and, as a result, burned their bodies into ash.<br> 
            <br> 
            The five Lords of Cinder are Ludleth the Exiled; Aldrich, Saint of the Deep; Farron's Undead Legion, the Abyss Watchers; <br> 
            the reclusive lord of the Profaned Capital, Yhorm the Giant; and Holy King Lothric, Last Hope of His Line. Lords of Cinder are past beings who were successful in linking the flame, being burned remnants of their past selves.<br> 
            Like in its predecessors, the story and lore of Dark Souls 3 can be pieced together through its introductory cinematic, item descriptions, dialogues, and environments.<br> 
            </p></div>

        <p>
            Yes, indeed. It is called Lothric, <br>
            Where the transitory lands of the Lords of Cinder converge.<br> 
            In venturing north, the pilgrims discover the truth of the old words. <br>
            “The fire fades, and the lords go without thrones.” <br>
            When the link of fire is threatened, the bell tolls, <br>
            unearthing the old Lords of Cinder from their graves. <br>
            Aldrich, Saint of the Deep. Farrons Undead Legion, The Abyss Watchers. <br>
             And the reclusive lord of the Profaned Capital, Yhorm the Giant.<br>
             Only, in truth... The Lords will abandon their thrones. <br>
            and the Unkindled will rise. <br>
             Nameless, accursed undead, <br>
             unfit even to be cinder. <br>
             And so it is. <br>
             That ash seeketh embers.</p><br>
