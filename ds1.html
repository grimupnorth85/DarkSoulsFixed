<h2>The Story..</h2>
<p>
    A lot of events happen before you even begin your adventure in Dark Souls.<br>
    Ages before you escape the Undead Asylum, there was nothing but fog.<br>
    No one lived, no one died. Only dragons existed, eternally watching over everything.<br>
    This era was called the Age of the Ancients...
    <br>
    <br>
    Underground, a magical fire, called the First Flame, suddenly sparked, attracting many humanoid creatures.<br>
    This legendary Flame created the dichotomies between light and dark, and life and death.<br>
    Essentially, it put time in motion. Three creatures went into the Flame and claimed a Lord Soul.<br>
    Gwyn took the Lord Soul of Light, while the Witch of Izalith took the Soul of Life. Nito claimed the Soul of Death.<br>
    This granted them great power, turning them into living gods.
    <br>
    <br>
    Meanwhile, the Furtive Pygmy found the Dark Soul, which provided Hollows with a precious thing called Humanity.<br>
    Thus, humans were born unto this world, but their power paled in comparison to the three Lords.
    <br>
    <br>
    With this newfound power, the three Lords waged war against the dragons above ground so they could claim the surface.<br>
    Unfortunately, these dragons were unable to be killed by normal means.<br>
    One dragon, Seath the Scaleless, betrayed his kind because, as you'd guess from his name, he was born without scales.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    He reveals to the Lords that dragons are immortal as long as they have their stone scales.<br>
    However, the destructive power of lightning could strip them of their defenses.<br>
    So Gwyn harnessed some lightning bolts, opening the path for the other two Lords to secure victory.<br>
    <br>
    Nito released the plague of death upon the vulnerable dragons. Meanwhile, the Witch of Izalith burned their homes, so they would have nowhere to run.<br>
    This series of events wiped out almost all the dragons in the world, leaving only weaker imitators, like drakes and wyverns.<br>
    The only true dragon remaining was Seath. Thus, the Lords moved to the surface, claiming it for themselves.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
<h3 >Backstory..</h3>
<br>
<p >"In the Age of Ancients, the world was unformed, shrouded by fog. A land of gray crags, Archtrees and Everlasting Dragons.<br>
But then there was fire, and with fire came disparity. Heat and cold, life and death, and of course, light and dark.<br>
Then from the dark, they came, and found the Souls of Lords within the flame.<br>
Nito, the first of the dead,<br>
the Witch of Izalith, and her Daughters of Chaos,<br>
Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight, and his faithful knights,<br>
and the furtive pygmy, so easily forgotten.<br>
<br>
<br>
"With the Strength of Lords, they challenged the Dragons.<br>
Gwyn's mighty bolts peeled apart their stone scales.<br>
The Witches weaved great firestorms.<br>
Nito unleashed a miasma of death and disease.<br>
And Seath the Scaleless betrayed his own, and the Dragons were no more.<br>
<br>
<br>
"Thus began the Age of Fire. But soon, the flames will fade, and only Dark will remain.<br>
Even now, there are only embers, and man sees not light, but only endless nights.<br>
And amongst the living are seen, carriers of the accursed Darksign."<br>
<br>
<br>
"Yes, indeed. The Darksign brands the Undead.<br>
And in this land, the Undead are corralled and led to the north,<br>
where they are locked away, to await the end of the world.<br>
... This is your fate."</p>
